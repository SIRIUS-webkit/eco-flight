# EcoFly 🌍✈️

Ecofly focuses on carbon emission tracking and offsetting by flight users. The project includes several components: a flight form where users input flight details to calculate the carbon emissions generated; a donation system that accepts cryptocurrency and rewards users with eco tokens; a carbon offset projects form that allows green initiatives to provide their information and join our platform; and a RAG chatbot that guides users by suggesting suitable carbon offset projects based on their preferences and encouraging donations.

- **Donation System**: Donate to verified green projects using cryptocurrency and receive eco-tokens as rewards.
- **Carbon Offset Projects**: Explore and support projects focused on reforestation, renewable energy, and other sustainable initiatives.
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilize Ethereum-based contracts for emission tracking and eco-token issuance.
- **Web3 Integration**: Enable seamless interaction with blockchain wallets for secure and transparent transactions.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: AI-powered chatbot to guide users through emission calculations, offset suggestions, and donations.
